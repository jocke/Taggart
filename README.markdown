Taggart surrounds your strings with HTML Tags
=============================================
How and what
------------
```ruby
  include Taggart::API
  taggart("Hello World!").h1.to_s
```

returns

```html
  <h1>Hello World!</h1>
```

or try (in bad typographical taste) 

```ruby
  taggart("Important!").em.strong.to_s
```

to get 

```html
  <strong><em>Important!</em></strong>
```

or do some more nesting 

```ruby
  (taggart("Label").td + taggart("Value").td).tr.table.to_s
```

to render a small table

```html
  <table><tr><td>Label</td><td>Value</td></tr></table>
```

Add HTML attributes as Ruby parameters.

```ruby
  taggart("hello").span(class: 'stuff', id: 'thing').to_s
```

to get a nice HTML string like this

```html
  <span class="stuff" id="thing">hello</span>
```

You can also use arrays, how about this table?

```ruby
  (taggart(%w(r1c1 r1c2 r1c3)).td.tr + taggart(%w(r2c1 r2c2 r2c3)).td.tr).table.to_s
```

will produce this HTML (author's line breaks and indentation)

```html
  <table>
    <tr>
      <td>r1c1</td>
      <td>r1c2</td>
      <td>r1c3</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>r2c1</td>
      <td>r2c2</td>
      <td>r2c3</td>
    </tr>
  </table>
```

Naturally we can do single tags too.

```ruby
  taggart("Gimme a").br.to_s
```

will return.

```html
  Gimme a<br />
```
You can choose to close the tag with `Taggart.close_ending_tag` or keep the tag open (default as of 0.0.8) with `Taggart.open_ending_tag`.


Also try some of the 'cleverness', for example calling `.script` on a `.js` file will yield a different result compared to running it on a Javascript. 
Like this:

```ruby
  taggart("alert('This string will pop up an alert!')").script.to_s
```

gives you

```html
  <script type="text/javascript">alert('This string will pop up an alert!')</script>
```

whereas this string

```ruby
  taggart("/script/awesome_script.js").script.to_s
```

gives you this

```html
  <script type="text/javascript" src="/script/awesome_script.js"></script>
```

Calling `.ol` or `.ul` on an array, will generate a full ordered or unordered list, like this

```ruby
  taggart(%w(First Second Third)).ol
```

returns

```html
  <ol><li>First</li><li>Second</li><li>Third</li></ol>
```


Naturally they all also work with attributes.

See the `spec/taggart_spec.rb` for more examples (until I have time to do a bigger-better-faster-example file).


Informational:
--------------
If you get lost in Taggart or if you're just curious about what Taggart
can do, I've created a few informational things for you. In the IRB
console you can now run:

```ruby
   Taggart.help  # For generic information about Taggart (or Taggart.info)
   puts Taggart.tags  # For a list of different tags and other curious things.
```

There's also some constants that you can access, such as `VERSION`, and
tags, see the aforementioned `Taggart.help` and `Taggart.tags`.

Background:
-----------
I have a lot of Ruby code that marks some String in an HTML tag, usually with a 
specific CSS class. Or perhaps a link or so.
It's not particularly nice to write `"<strong>#{my_variable}</strong>"`. The more 
complex the Ruby code is, the worse it is to have `"`, `#`, `{` or `}` soiling the code.
I was looking at the code and I thought, wouldn't it be nice if I could just tell that piece
of String that it's supposed to be a `<span>` or some other tag. One could simply 
write `taggart(my_variable).strong.to_s` to get the job done. **Taggart** was born.

The Idea
--------
The idea was to simplify the code and make it easier and faster for me to add arbitrary HTML into my
non-HTML code. I wanted to stop breaking my fingers trying to get the _quote-string-hash-curlybrackets-code-curlybrackets-morestrings-quote_
right on my keyboard.
It was _never_ intended to be a full-fledged HTML page renderer. If you want to use it for that, I'd love to see the result, though.


Installation:
-------------
Install the gem:

```
  gem install taggart
```
  
Then load Taggart with:

```
  require 'taggart'
```

Taggart is now active, which means you can play around.


History
-------

- Added HTML5 tags - the list is not complete, let me know what I've
  missed.
- Added ability to have closed and open endings on single tags (i.e `<br>`
  and `<br />`.
- Moved help to a separate module.
- Added informational Taggart.help and Taggart.tags.
- Moved several tags into arrays for easier reference.
- Created Taggart::VERSION and Taggart::BUILD for reference and DRYness.
- Changed some of the labels in the test file.
- Added `<table>` to Array that creates single or multi row tables.
- Added `<ol>` and `<ul>` tags to the Array so you can now generate lists in one fast action.
- Added `<script>`-tag. You can now add `"my-script.js".script` and `"alert('Hello World!')".script`.
- Added several tags (still not a complete list, tweet or send a pull request for more tags.)
- Removed several `if DEBUG` lines
- Removed examples and most comments from taggart.rb file
- Converted the README to markdown for a bit better formatting fun.
- Added `.href` and `.img` feature.
- Created Gem
- Pushed code to Git.
- Created test Gem.
- Added files to create Gem and reorganised the file structure.
- Made `dual_sub()` pass all the tests, and added the examples from `.tr` (translate) Ruby docs to the test.
- More work on the "dynamic namespace clash resolver", in other words, `.tr` and sub work in both classic and Taggart way.
- Initial version of "dynamic namespace clash resolver" to fix issues with `.tr`.
- Added basic RSpec test.
- Added namespacing for Strings and Arrays.
- Implemented arrays; `["Label", "Value"].td.tr.table` and `["First", "Second", "Third"].li.ol`.
- Tidied up things a bit.
- Added a version of attributes `"Red".span(class: 'red')`.
- First version. Basic tags.


Future???
---------
With your blessing. Like Ozzy said; _"The crazier you get, the crazier Ozzy gets!"_, or something.

* Potential validations, could check file, size, etc
* Full fledged examples.
* Please send suggestions.


Issues:
-------
- `"hello".sub('world', 'world')` returns `<sub  world  world>hello</sub>`. Not really perfect.
- Please help me test it out.
